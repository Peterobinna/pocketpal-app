# PocketPal

## A simple savings and budget tracker for African university students.

---

# Project Overview

PocketPal is a full-stack web application that helps African university students monitor their finances by setting savings goals and recording income and expenses.

The application allows users to create savings goals, monitor their savings progress, and keep a simple transaction history. It was developed as part of a DevOps course project to demonstrate collaborative software development, version control, backend API development, and frontend integration.

# Problem Statement

Many university students struggle to manage their finances effectively. Weekly allowances, mobile money transactions, irregular income, and daily expenses make it difficult to save consistently and monitor spending.

Most existing budgeting applications are either too complex, require paid subscriptions, or are designed for users with more advanced financial needs.

PocketPal provides a simple, lightweight budgeting tool designed specifically for African university students.

# API Endpoints

## Savings Goals

### GET

```
GET /api/goals
```

Returns all savings goals.

---

### POST

```
POST /api/goals
```

Creates a new savings goal.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Laptop Fund",
  "targetAmount": 500000,
  "savedAmount": 150000,
  "category": "Education"
}
```

---

## Transactions

### GET

```
GET /api/transactions
```

Returns all transactions.

---

### POST

```
POST /api/transactions
```

Creates a new transaction.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "expense",
  "amount": 2500,
  "category": "Food",
  "description": "Lunch on campus",
  "date": "2026-06-25"
}
```

# How to Run the Frontend

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Peterobinna/pocketpal-app.git
```

Move into the project.

```bash
cd pocketpal-app
```

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the frontend.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

# How to Run the Backend

Open another terminal.

Move into the server folder.

```bash
cd server
```

Install backend dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Start the Express server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

# Git Workflow

This project follows a collaborative Git workflow.

Each team member:

- Pulls the latest code from `main`
- Creates a new feature branch
- Makes changes
- Commits changes
- Pushes the branch
- Opens a Pull Request
- Receives code review
- Merges into `main`

Example:

```bash
git checkout main

git pull origin main

git checkout -b feature/example-feature
```

---

# Branch Protection

The `main` branch is protected using GitHub Branch Protection Rules.

The repository requires:

- Pull Requests before merging
- At least one approval before merge
- Branches to be up to date before merging
- Conversation resolution before merging
- Protection applied to administrators

These practices help maintain code quality and encourage collaborative development.

---

# GitHub Project Board

Project management is handled using GitHub Projects in Kanban view.

The board contains:

- Backlog
- In Progress
- Done

Tasks are assigned to individual team members with labels for:

- Frontend
- Backend
- DevOps
- Documentation
- Security
- Testing

GitHub Project Board:

```
Paste your GitHub Project Board link here.

## DevOps Evidence

The team used GitHub Projects to plan and manage development work using a Kanban workflow.

The board includes:

- Backlog
- In Progress
- Done

The team also used labels to organise work by category:

- frontend
- backend
- devops
- documentation
- security
- testing
- feature

The `main` branch is protected using branch protection rules. Pull requests are required before merging, at least one approval is required, conversations must be resolved, and branches must be up to date before merge.

This supports secure collaboration and helps prevent accidental direct changes to the main branch.

---
## Running with Docker Compose

PocketPal can be run locally using Docker Compose.

### Build and start all services

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The command builds the Docker images (if required) and starts both the frontend and backend containers.

### Frontend

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

### Backend

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

### Stop the containers

```bash
docker compose down
```

This stops and removes all running containers created by Docker Compose.

---
## CI Pipeline

PocketPal uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically validate every code change before it is merged into the `main` branch.

The CI pipeline automatically performs the following tasks:

- Installs project dependencies
- Runs ESLint to check code quality
- Executes frontend tests
- Executes backend tests
- Builds the Docker images

The workflow is triggered when:

- A developer pushes to any branch except `main`
- A Pull Request is opened or updated targeting the `main` branch

If any linting, test, or Docker build step fails, the entire workflow fails and the Pull Request cannot be merged until the issue is fixed.
